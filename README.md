# Bullshit problems with {gnome|emacs|popos|ubuntu} and the weird hacks to get around them:

Each of these throws me some weird, obscure and unintuitive error at the combined rate of ~1 per week. Often, the same issue reappears after updating either one of these. So, rather than keep having to go down the search rabbit hole on GH. I want to keep track of the recurring problems here so that I may find the "fixes" more quickly in the future.
